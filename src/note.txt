-> BrowserRouter is the wrapper of React BrowserRouter.
-> Inside the BrowserRouter we can Define Routes ,Route.
Ex-1  <Route path='/about' element={<About/>}/>
Ex-2   <Route path='/contact' element={<Navigate to='/about'/>}/>
-> By using Link tag we can define link.  Ex-  <Link to='/about'>About</Link> 

-> useParams are used to receive parameter.

Q/A

1.Link vs NavLink
-> With NavLink we can add custom style and classes
->With NavLink we can add active link feature
-> style is not recommened with Link


useParams
----------

-> It is used to get dynamic routing value
ex- localhost:3000/user/100
ex-localhost:3000/user/101
100 is the dynamic value here

useSearchParam
--------------
-> it is use for get query params
ex- localhost:3000/user?id=100
    id=100 query param here


Hash Route vs Browser router
----------------------------

-> mostly we use Browser Route
-> Hash Route used for hiding route from the server
Ex- Browser Route:localhost:3000/about
Ex- Hash Route: localhost:3000#about
